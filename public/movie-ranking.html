<h1>Brian's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Even though all three movies are terrific in their own rights, together they make up a master piece of film. The acting, special affects, sound track, story writting makes this trilogy one of the greatest stories / movies ever made.</p>
<h3>Her</h3>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson are such a great cast together in this movie, the way they have so much chemistry is unbeaten. The only thing I could describe this movie the first time I watched it was "Beautiful".</p>
<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>I couldn't have a list of top movies without a horror movie in here. The Conjuring to me is one of my favorite horror movies, even though there have been more movies made in the series none can top the original one.</p>
